 1.	go to http://supercollider.sourceforge.org or google supercollider and find the sourcefourge page.

2. Download SuperCollider for windows, follow installation instructions.

3. Open SuperCollider. Press cntrl + n to get a new window

4. paste this in : 

Platform.userExtensionDir;

5. select that text, then press 'Lang' menu and select 'Evaluate' or press alt + enter ( I think)

6. put genLoop.sc into the folder that it prints out.

7. copy paste this into SuperCollider:

s.waitForBoot({x = GenLoop.new(120, 4, 40)}); 

and Evaluate or alt + Enter it.

This will create a looper at 120bpm, 4/4, with 40 seconds of recording time. You can change these numbers.


Using the Program:

When you press record, recording will start AT THE NEXT BEAT, not when you press record. It also stops at the next beat, this means you should get perfect loops (there may be bugs).

So to loop a one bar phrase, press record AFTER beat 4 but BEFORE beat 1. Then stop after beat 4 and BEFORE beat 1.

You can record loops that are any number of beats long, so like 6 beats even if in 4/4.

After you record a loop you MUST press the analyse button and wait until the textbox says 'Analysis Finished'

Then you can press the looping button to change to cutting, and adjust the slider to increase probability of notes.
